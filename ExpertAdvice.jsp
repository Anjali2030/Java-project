        <h2>1.Plant a Variety of Crops </h2>
        <p>Rotating your plants promotes biodiversity. It also improves your soil quality and helps control pests.
            One method for adding diversity is intercropping. This involves growing a variety of vegetation in one
            area. Another trick is to rotate crops every three to four years. If you have a smaller space, create
            raised beds, use pots, or coordinate with friends. </p>

        <h2>2.Grow Cover Plants </h2>
        <p>Cover crops are used to enclose the soil instead of being harvested. These plants, such as clover, are
            usually grown during the off-season. These plants protect the soil by preventing erosion and supplying
            nutrients. In addition, they help control weeds and reduce the need for herbicides.<br><br>
            When selecting your cover vegetation consider the following:<br></p>

        <ul>
            <li>What is your primary goal?</li>
            <li>When is the best time and place to add them?</li>
            <li>How do and when do you plan to seed them? </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3.Reduce Your Tillage </h2>
        <p>Tillage is traditional plowing which involves preparing the soil by digging and overturning. However,
            this can cause dirt loss. Instead, try to insert seeds directly into untouched mulch. The technique can
            also reduce erosion and improve soil health. Keep in mind you’ll need special equipment, such as disc
            seeders or agricultural drills. </p>

        <h2>4.Using Integrated Pest Management Practices (IPM) </h2>
        <p>IPM is one of the best farming techniques to control pests. It uses a variety of methods, such as
            biological controls, to get rid of critters. For example, natural enemies, such as predators or
            parasites are introduced.<br>

            To decide if IPM is the best strategy for you, do some research. Check your field to identify which
            insects are present and what damage they caused. This specific information allows you to determine the
            best management strategy.<br>

            Here are some other common techniques used: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cultural control</li>
            <li>Chemical control</li>
            <li>Mechanical and physical control </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5.Try Hydroponics and Aquaponics Methods </h2>
        <p>These techniques focus on growing plants without soil. Instead, nourish them with specialized nutrients
            and water. For hydroponic systems, the vegetation is grown in a mineral solution with gravel. The
            benefits of this method include conserving space and water and requiring less labor.<br><br>

            Aquaponics combines raising aquatic animals, like fish, with growing hydroponic plants. The waste
            material from the fish is used to nourish the crops. Then any leftover water is reused by the fish. This
            process prevents resources from going to waste. In fact, agriculture accounts for 80% of our water use.
            Also, Aquaponics doesn’t rely on pesticides that can harm the environment. Both hydroponic and aquaponic
            systems are available for residential or commercial use. </p>
